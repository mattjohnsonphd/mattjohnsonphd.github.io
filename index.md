I am a Senior Research Scientist at Amazon on the Topline Forecasting Team in Bellevue, Washington. My personal research focuses on Bayesian methods for predictive forecast combination (Bayesian Predictive Synthesis), and other interests include time series, stochastic processes, dynamic models, forecasting and Bayesian statistics.

I earned my Ph.D. from Duke University's Department of Statistical Science, under adviser Mike West. Before coming to Duke, I earned a BA in Mathematics and Statistics from Northwestern University and an MS in Financial Mathematics from the University of Chicago. I also spent a few years trading American and Australian interest rate futures in downtown Chicago and working at a quantitative hedge fund in Durham.
